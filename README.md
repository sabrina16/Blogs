# Programming Languages Blog

Hi! Our names are Sabrina Toubbeh and Gregory Albarian. For our class project, we have decided to implement 
a mortgage calculator in the programming language Common Lisp. Our goal is to add some features that other 
fundamental mortgage calculators don't offer. 

## Timeline
Concept Stage (DUE DATE: October 20th, 2018):
Decide on what concept we want to implement in Common Lisp and how we are going to do it. 

Defintion Stage (DUE DATE: October 28th, 2018):
Research and gather how to program in Common Lisp. Write a blog on basic syntax to help us implement 
our design concept. 

Implementation Stage (DUE DATE: November 28th, 2018):
Implement mortage calculator. Write a blog about File I/O to add as a feature in our code. Add File I\O to our code. 

Testing Stage (DUE DATE: December 7th, 2018):
Compile and run the program. Fix any outstanding bugs. Blog post about project and Common Lisp.
