# Programming Languages Blog

Hi! Our names are Sabrina Toubbeh and Gregory Albarian. For our class project, we have decided to implement 
a mortgage calculator in the programming language Common Lisp. Our mortgage calculator computes monthly payments 
when the user inputs the annual rate, principal, and time on the loan. Our mortgage calculator also has the ability
to allow the user to keep track of multiple loans by writing the data inputted and the monthly payment to a file.

## Timeline
Concept Stage (DUE DATE: October 20th, 2018):
Decide on what concept we want to implement in Common Lisp and how we are going to do it. 

Defintion Stage (DUE DATE: October 28th, 2018):
Research and gather how to program in Common Lisp. Write a blog on basic syntax to help us implement 
our design concept. 

Implementation Stage (DUE DATE: November 28th, 2018):
Implement mortage calculator. Write a blog about File I/O to add as a feature in our code. Add File I\O to our code. 

Testing Stage (DUE DATE: December 7th, 2018):
Compile and run the program. Fix any outstanding bugs. Blog post about project and Common Lisp.
