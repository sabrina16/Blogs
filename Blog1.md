# Common Lisp
Hello! Our names are Sabrina Toubbeh and Gregory Albarian. We are both students attending Chapman University with a declared major
in computer science. I, Sabrina Toubbeh, am a senior but I will be graduating December 2019. Hi! Gregory here. I am a sophmore and also
have a minor in math! For programming languages, we picked the language Common Lisp to learn and research.



## Why we picked Common Lisp
One of the reasons why we picked Common Lisp is because the computer science department at Chapman mainly offers courses in Java or C-based
languages. We also asked a few professors for advice, and researched all the different options and suggestions we were given. After a few
hours of researching, we found that Common Lisp best suited our interests beyond the scope of programming languages. We also
found it interesting that a lot of qualities that exist in C-based languages orginally existed in Lisp-based languages. Another thing we
discovered was that when Artifical Intelligence was evolving, a lot of the research was being done using Lisp-based languages.
Lisp-based languages are actually the 3rd most commonly used language for Artifical Intelligence. Common Lisp was also used to program
Grammarly, which rely's on AI! P.S Github uses Grammarly https://github.com/grammarly 


## What we hope to achieve
Although our program will not support Artifical Intelligence due to our limited knowledge of statistics, probability, and lingustics,
we believe that we can use Common Lisp to develop a program using very basic AI principles. Another idea we had in mind was a
mortgage caculator.
